Key findings: 4 program types mentioned (Public Housing, Project-Based Voucher, Housing Choice Voucher, Project-Based Rental Assistance Program), target populations include families, seniors (62+), veterans, disabled, and homeless populations. The leasing outcomes data provides valuable insights into application success rates and common barriers. Transfer waitlist data shows internal mobility options for existing residents. All files are Excel format and appear to contain the core data needed for eligibility matching."
