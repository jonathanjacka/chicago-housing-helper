    "notes": "Found comprehensive housing waitlist data from CHA's transparency portal. The most recent data is from 2025 Q2 for waitlist properties and totals, plus 2025 Q3 for leasing outcomes. The data covers multiple program types (Public Housing, Project-Based Vouchers, Housing Choice Voucher, Project-Based Rental Assistance Program) and target populations (families, seniors, supportive housing for homeless/veterans/disabled). Key data includes property codes, waitlist names, target populations, program types, applicant totals, and leasing outcomes. This should provide excellent foundation for helping residents identify eligible housing programs."
